# Final Project

This project will conclude my semester in Data Structure.

## Objectives

This project is way dificult than the others assignments.

We gonna use Dinamic Lists to simulate a Disk Database, a Bidirectional Linked List for ordering the data, and a Binary Tree for Primary Keys indexes.

## Data

- CPF as Primary Key (Cadastro de Pessoa FÃ­sica - Individual Taxpayer Registration)
- Name as Ordering Index
- Address
- Telephone number
- Email

## Modules

The main file will access the Dinamic List as the Database, which will contain all the data listed above; the Bidirectional Linked List as the ordering index, containing only the name and registry number, and the Binary Tree as the Primary Key, containing only the CPF and registry number.
