## Professor

Marcos Nava

## Folders Explanation

All folders that have a `_MP` on it's name, is a resource that professor Marcos Nava provided for us.
Folders that have `Assignment` on it's name, is a project with a due date to present to the professor.
Any other folder is just a study related, so I can improve my skills within that topic
